            <header>-- Week 8 Reflection --</header>
            <p>Week 8 was a more technical session where we learnt about Arduino IDE which allowed us to implement code into our circuits. One circuit we made was a photoresistor servo motor which I 3d modelled. It was essentially touch controlled as the more your finger covers the resistor the more the servo will move. </p>
            <p>From the lecture, I was drawn in by the Japanese concept of Chindogu which were unuseless inventions. I felt it was a humorous take on this subject but also a very creative pathway, it was definitely a large inspiration for my final project.</p>
            <p>This week saw more design on my homepage, namely the UI section. While browsing the Interactive Media case studies on Milanote I was drawn in by an article on the original MacPaint and thought it was an interesting take on interface. Namely, I liked how everything was sectioned into boxes, and thus it became a starting point for my homepage.</p>
