            <header>-- Week 9 Reflection --</header>
            <p>Week 9's class taught us how to bring data from Arduino and port it into p5 so that we can make connections between physical computing and creative coding. This example was done through a serial port circuit which I had chosen as my 3d model, the Arduino Ide code reads the serial data from the potentiometer and transfers that data into p5 which then we can manipulate. </p>
            <p>There have been huge leaps in my workbook, I had improved the UI styling and functionality and successfully incorporated the 3d models into the webpage. While making this interface, I was largely reminded of the similarities it had with a game called “Fallout”, they both shared a retro sort of style in their menus and certain stylistic choices were inspired from the game.</p>
            <p>Overall, it was really nice to see how the workbook was inspired, how the content evolved and certainly the improvement in my understanding of physical computing.</p>
